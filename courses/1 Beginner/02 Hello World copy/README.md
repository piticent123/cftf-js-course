# 02 Hello World
This program ("Hello, world!") is the first program written when learning any tool or language.
It might seem simple, but to finish it, you have to:
- Have access to an editor (and know how to use it)
- Know what the structure of a basic project in your chosen language looks like
- Be able to create a file in that language with some correct structure or syntax
- Know how to run this program either from the command line or your editor
- Be able to find where "Hello, world!" was printed

That's a lot of stuff!
